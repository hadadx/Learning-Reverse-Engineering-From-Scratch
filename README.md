# 🛠️ Reverse Engineering Journey

Welcome to my journey into the world of **Reverse Engineering** — a deep dive into understanding how things truly work under the hood.

---

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

I've decided to learn reverse engineering from scratch as a hobby.  
My main goal is to **understand how software and systems work**, from the lowest levels up.

## 📘 What This README Is About

This file will serve as a **log of my progress**, as well as a list of **resources, tools, and topics** I explore along the way.

## 🧱 Where I Started

Since reverse engineering often requires low-level knowledge, I started by learning the C programming language.  
Although I already have some experience with high-level languages, I wanted to go back to the roots and build a solid foundation.

## 📚 Current Learning Resource

I'm currently learning C using what many consider the best resource:

> **"The C Programming Language"** by Kernighan and Ritchie (2nd Edition)

You can find the PDF here:
